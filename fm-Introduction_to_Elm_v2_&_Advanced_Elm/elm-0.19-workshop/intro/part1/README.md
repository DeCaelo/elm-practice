# Part 1

To build everything, `cd` into the `part1/` directory and run:

```shell
elm make Main.elm --output elm.js
```

This will compile your Main.elm file into `elm.js`, which gets loaded by
`index.html`.

Then open `index.html` in your browser.

## Exercise

Open `Main.elm` in your editor and resolve the TODOs there.

After you complete each one, re-run `elm make Main.elm --output elm.js` to
recompile the `elm.js` file, then refresh the browser to see the results!
