# Part 2

This is just like last time, except `Main.elm` is now in the `src/` directory.

To build everything, `cd` into the `part2/` directory and run:

```shell
elm make src/Main.elm --output elm.js
```

Then open `index.html` in your browser.

## Exercise

Open `src/Main.elm` in your editor and resolve the TODOs there.
