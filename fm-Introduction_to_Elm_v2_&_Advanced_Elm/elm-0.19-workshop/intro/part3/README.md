# Part 3

This is just like last time, except first we'll install the `elm/browser` package so we can create an interactive app in the browser, instead of static HTML.

To install the package, `cd` into the `part3/` directory and run:

```shell
elm install elm/browser
```

Then build everything the same way as last time:

```shell
elm make src/Main.elm --output elm.js
```

Finally, open `index.html` in your browser.

## Exercise

Open `src/Main.elm` in your editor and resolve the TODOs there.
