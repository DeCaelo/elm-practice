Introduction to Elm Workshop
============================

If you haven't already, follow the [Getting Started instructions](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-0.19-workshop#getting-started
) at the root of this repository, then continue here!

## Start the server

We'll be running a local server for our Elm UI to use. Let's get it set up.

```shell
cd intro/server
npm install
npm start
```

If the server started up successfully, you should see
`> moleculer-runner services` at the end of your terminal.

We're going to leave this server running and not touch it again for the duration
of the workshop, so **don't close it** until the workshop is over!

## Build the Elm UI

Leave the existing terminal running, and open a **second** terminal.

In the new terminal, `cd` into the `elm-0.19-workshop/intro/server/` directory again.

Then run this to build the Elm code for the first time:

```shell
elm make src/Main.elm --output=../server/public/elm.js
```

## Verify your setup

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
in your browser. You should see this in it:

If things aren’t working, the instructor will be happy to help!
