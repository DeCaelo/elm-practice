# Part 6

Like last time, we'll be building `src/Main.elm`, but editing different files.

To build everything, `cd` into the `part6/` directory and run:

```shell
elm make src/Main.elm --output ../server/public/elm.js
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Exercise

There are two TODOs to resolve, in these files.

1. `src/Avatar.elm` - go for this one first!
2. `src/Page/Article/Editor.elm`
